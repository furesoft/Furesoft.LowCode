# What is Furesoft.LowCode?

A framwork to combine extendability and lowcode. It can be used to build plugins for people who doesn't have much knowlegdge about coding. It consists of two main components. The engine and the designer. The designer is written with AvaloniaUI. As backend language for expression is JavaScript used.

Instead of writing code the user combines nodes in a graph. There are some primitive nodes like Condition or Messagebox but more components can be added with modules like nodes for interacting with a REST api.
